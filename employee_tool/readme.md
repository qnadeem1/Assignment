# Employee Management Tool

###### In this exercise you'll build a tool that will manage employees.

###### Target Skills: Front-End

###### Estimated Completion: 2-4 hours


\**This exercise requires node for running an express server and reading file data. 
If you do not have node install you can download [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).*


## Your Job 
- Create a tool that can **list** all employees, **add** new employees, and **delete** old employees
- Employee fields include `id`, `name`, `role`, and `salary`
	- `id`   - hidden (generated by server)
	- `name`   - text (i.e. `'john doe'`)
	- `role`   - select [ intern, developer, manager ]
	- `salary` - text (i.e. `'60k'`)
- `GET` the employees at http://localhost:8080/employees 
- `POST` new employees at http://localhost:8080/employees 
	- Accepts an object with the employee fields (excluding the id)
- `DELETE` employees at http://localhost:8080/employees/:id


## Getting Setup
1. Download codebase
2. Open a terminal in this directory 
3. Type `npm install` - this installs the node dependencies for this exercise
4. Type `npm run start` - this runs your local server at http://localhost:8080/

## Notes
- All your code will be under the `src/` directory
- Set your content-type request header to `"application/json"`
- The server's response will be `"json"`
- Feel free to use any libs you may need
